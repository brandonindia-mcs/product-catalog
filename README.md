## Architecture
This is a 3-tiered web application: frontend, middleware, & backend, all served under Kubernetes.  It comes with a menu driver that cleanly performs the labeled action.
1. The frontend is a React web application.
1. The middleware is a node.js layer for logic & data access.
1. The backend is a postgres database.
